# data-entry-job

Is it possible to automate our job?
The jobs that tend to be easily automated using Python are data entry jobs, moving data from one format to another. 

I'm going to be tackling a research data entry job where I'm researching house prices that fit a particular criteria for a client on the Zillow website. And then I'm going to be transferring that data into a form which will create a spreadsheet in Google sheets.
